Design License
The look and feel of the OSM liberty map design is also derived (although heavily altered) from OSM Bright from Mapbox Open Styles which is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 license.

The map is displaying and styling the data from OpenMapTiles with CC-BY 4.0 design license.

The products or services using this map style need to visibly credit "OpenMapTiles.org" or reference "OpenMapTiles" with a link to http://openmaptiles.org/. For a browsable electronic map based on OpenMapTiles and OpenStreetMap data, the credit should appear in the corner of the map. For example:

© OpenMapTiles © OpenStreetMap contributors

For printed and static maps a similar attribution should be made in a textual description near the image, in the same fashion as if you cite a photograph.

Icons
OSM Liberty is using the Maki POI icon set which is licensed under CC0 1.0 Universal.

The right arrow was derived from Wikipedia which is in the public domain.

Fonts
OSM Liberty is using the Roboto font family (Copyright 2011 Google). Roboto is licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0.
